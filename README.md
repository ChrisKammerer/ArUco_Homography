# ArUco_Homography
This project uses OpenCV to place an image or video on top of an ArUco tag. 

In my first iteration of this project, I tried using a color mask and corner detection to do this. I started by using a small blue square piece of paper as my marker. I had a lot of experience with color masking and was able to create a good mask. I then tried a couple different ways to detect the corners of the square. First, I tried using OpenCV's built in Harris Corner detection function. Although this function successfully detected the corners of the mask, it often more or less than 4 corners. For my project to work, I needed to consistently find 4 corners to prevent unwanted errors in the homography process. The next method I tried was by using Hough Line detection and using the intersecting points between the lines as my corners. This was also inconsistent in the resulting data so I scrapped that idea. The last solution I tried involving color masking was by using the x and y values of the location of white pixels in the mask. Through this method, I always got 4 points, and I was able to successfully place an image on top of the blue square.
